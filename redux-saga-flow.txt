Step 1

    useEffect in App.js dispatches the getUser() action defined in ducks/user.js

Step 2

    Redux-saga is set up so that it watches for any actions that are dispatched

    When it does, our watcherSaga function in rootSaga.js, watches for specific actions, and map it to its handler functions

Step 3

    handlegetUser() is called, which calls requestgetUser() which makes the api call
    
    The response from requestGetUser() / the API call, is returned to our handler function, which then sets that data back into our Redux store

Step 4

    Since the data is in our Redux store, we are able to access it within any component in our app.
